            6.So a little about myself: my name is Yishai Samuel, and I'm from Israel.
             And my dream is to make learning much more interesting and better,
             both for students and teachers. That's why I made this question generator.
              You no longer need to keep worksheets. Everything is ready in a few seconds.

             <mark class="highlight"> I need your help. A teacher in Israel earns a very low salary,
                And it is very difficult to make a living as a teacher and a free software developer.</mark>
                I really want to continue developing content that will really, 
                really help students and teachers. But I have to take care of my little girls.

                Now I know that it must be difficult now in the middle of life to give a few shekels,
                 (Israeli money) but if you can buy some digital content from my store it will be very very very helpful to me. 
                 That way I can also take care of my daughters.
                 And I can develop a lot more quality and good material for students.

                 Now for any request and for anything, I would be very happy to hear your ideas. Contact me at yishaisanuel@gmail.com

Really for everything and thank you very much for everything. You don't know how much your support helps me.
